# Estimated and actual hours worked

| Name | Stuff | Estimated hrs | Actual hrs |
| Jay Patel | CSS UI | 1 | 1.25 |
| Arnav Jain | Bug testing + documentation | 1 | 1 |
| Brett Balquist | Main code structure + bug testing + documentation | 1.25 | 1 |
| Tej Gumaste | Game logic | 1.5 | 1.5 |
| Daniel Neugent | Core engine | 2 | 1.5 |

Jay's estimate: Finniky nature of CSS lead to an estimate of 1hr. UI is difficult
Arnav's estimation: Documentation can take a while so 45m + 15m of bug testing
Brett's estimation: Main code structure takes 15m, bug testing takes 15m, and documentation takes 45m
Tej's estimation: Game logic is a bit difficult and should take around 2 hours, but his familiarity with math and JavaScript, he should be able to do it faster so 1.5hrs
Daniel's estimation: Creating the engine and rendering mechanism can also be a bit hard. Moreso though is (once again) the UI, but Daniel's familiarity with JavaScript had us estimate 2hrs.
